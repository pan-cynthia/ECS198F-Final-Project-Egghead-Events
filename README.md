Running the app:
Almost everything should work immediately. However, Google sign-in may require some extra steps in
order to work properly. You will need to send us a SHA-1 hash from your computer. Open the gradle
tab in Android Studio, click on Tasks -> android -> signingReport and execute that Gradle task.
Then send the SHA-1 key labeled as "Variant: debug" either to smkuhne@ucdavis.edu, or
ArtificialStupidity#1405 on Discord.
